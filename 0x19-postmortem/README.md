Postmortem Report: Service Outage on 2023-06-20
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: 2023-06-20, 14:30 - 15:45 UTC (1 hour 15 minutes)
Impact:
Service: E-commerce platform
User experience: Users were unable to complete transactions. Approximately 60% of users experienced slow response times, and 30% were unable to access the checkout page.
Percentage of Users Affected: 90% of active users during the outage
Root Cause: Database server failure due to high CPU usage caused by an unoptimized query.
Timeline
14:30 UTC: Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating high response times.
14:32 UTC: Engineers began investigating the alert.
14:35 UTC: Initial assumption was a DDoS attack due to high traffic volume.
14:40 UTC: Network team checked firewall and traffic logs, found no signs of external attack.
14:45 UTC: Incident escalated to the database team for further investigation.
15:00 UTC: Database logs reviewed; identified a specific query causing CPU spikes.
15:10 UTC: Query optimization team consulted to rewrite the problematic query.
15:30 UTC: New optimized query deployed.
15:45 UTC: Service confirmed restored, and response times normalized.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a poorly optimized database query that caused the database server's CPU to spike, leading to slow responses and eventual failure of the database server to handle incoming requests. The query in question was introduced in a recent update to enhance product search functionality but was not adequately tested for performance under high traffic conditions.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by identifying the specific query causing the CPU spike and optimizing it. The problematic query was rewritten to improve its efficiency, reducing CPU load. Additionally, the deployment was rolled back to the previous stable version while the optimization was in progress to minimize the impact on users.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Enhanced Query Testing: Implement a more rigorous testing process for database queries, especially those that affect high-traffic areas.
Performance Monitoring: Introduce more granular monitoring of database performance metrics to detect similar issues earlier.
Capacity Planning: Reevaluate the capacity planning and scaling strategy for the database servers to handle unexpected spikes in load more gracefully.
Tasks:
Query Optimization:
Review and optimize all recent database query changes.
Implement query performance testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Monitoring Enhancements:
Add detailed CPU and query performance monitoring on all database servers.
Set up alerts for unusual query patterns or performance degradation.
Capacity Planning:
Conduct a thorough analysis of current database server capacity and plan for scaling.
Implement auto-scaling for database servers to handle traffic spikes.
Documentation and Training:
Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.
Conduct training sessions for engineers on query optimization and performance monitoring.
Incident Response:
Review and update the incident response plan to ensure quicker identification of database-related issues.
Conduct regular drills to improve team response times and efficiency.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar issues in the future and ensure a more robust and resilient service.
